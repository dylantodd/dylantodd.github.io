### Personal Website 

_Hello, World!_

Thanks for stopping by my personal website. 
Take a look around!

I enjoy learning, thinking and creating.

Currently, I am working on several mobile applications that I believe will make the world a more secure, interesting and enjoyable place to live.

I have been trained in Economics from the University of Wyoming, and utilize that knowledge in my 
attempts to understand and tackle difficult questions.

I also enjoy reading, exploring the mountains, spending time with my family, and traveling.

I am an alumni of [Phillips Exeter Academy](https://www.exeter.edu/), and a student at the [University of Wyoming](http://www.uwyo.edu/).
