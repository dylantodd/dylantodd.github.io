_Hello, World!_

I am a cybersecurity professional based in Jelm, WY.

In my free time, I enjoy studying cybersecurity, analyzing risk postures and programming   
software that I believe will make the world more safe and secure. I have been trained in   
Economics from the University of Wyoming, and utilize that knowledge in my attempts to   
tackle big data questions.

I also enjoy reading, exploring the mountains, snowboarding and traveling.

I am an alumni of [Phillips Exeter Academy](https://www.exeter.edu/), and a student of both  
[Laramie County Community College](https://www.lccc.wy.edu/) and the [University of Wyoming](http://www.uwyo.edu/).
