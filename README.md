In my free time, I enjoy programming software that I beleive will make the world more  
safe and secure. I have been trained in Economics from the University of Wyoming, and  
utilize that knowledge in my attempts to tackle big data questions.

I also enjoy reading, exploring the mountains, snowboarding and travelling.

I am an alumni of Phillips Exeter Academy, and a current student at both Laramie County  
Community College and the University of Wyoming.

## Projects 

The following are a few projects that I am currently working on.
