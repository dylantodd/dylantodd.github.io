_Hello, World!_

I am a cybersecurity professional based in Jelm, WY.

In my free time, I enjoy studying cybersecurity, analyzing risk postures and programming   
software that I believe will make the world more safe and secure. I have been trained in   
Economics from the University of Wyoming, and utilize that knowledge in my attempts to   
tackle big data questions.

I also enjoy reading, exploring the mountains, snowboarding and travelling.

I am an alumni of [Phillips Exeter Academy](https://www.exeter.edu/), and a student of both  
[Laramie County Community College](https://www.lccc.wy.edu/) and the [University of Wyoming](http://www.uwyo.edu/).

## Projects 

Here are a few projects that I am currently working on -  

### mechChain
##### [mechChain repository](https://github.com/dylantodd/mechChain)


    Mechanical records retrievable by VIN (for generation of pub_key, verified on the Block Chain. 
    
    Task List: 
    - [ ] put together framework for block
    - [ ] put together framework for blockchain
    - [x] establish working digSig system
    - [x] successful generation of pub/priv keys
    - [ ] design program to allow input onto blockchain from mechanics 
    - [ ] allow user to forward mechChain for purpose of selling vehicle / verifying maintenance 
    - [ ] create system for proving work, distribute processing power on reward system
    - [ ] create mobile front end to extend program's capabilities to application lvl

### cancerLancer
##### [cancerLancer repository](https://github.com/dylantodd/cancerLancer)


    This project focuses on creating a program small enough to be implemented in nanobot   
    technology to detect the presence of abnormalities in the body when explored through   
    the circulatory system.

    Task List: 
    - [ ] accumulate data sets of normal entities in circulatory system
      - [x] red blood cells
      - [x] white blood cells
      - [ ] platelets
      - [ ] salts
      - [ ] protein 
    - [ ] accumulate data sets of foreign entities in circulatory system 
      - [ ] pathogens
      - [ ] cancerous cells
    - [ ] program vision recognition capabilities 
    - [ ] develop ability to compare object in front of nanobot to databases of   
          normal as well as foreign entities
    - [ ] condense program down to size appropriate for nanobot technology
