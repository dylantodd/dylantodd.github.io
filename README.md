In my free time, I enjoy learning as much as possible, analyzing risk postures and programming   
software that I believe will make the world a more secure, interesting and enjoyable place to live. 
I have been trained in Economics from the University of Wyoming, and utilize that knowledge in my 
attempts to understand and tackle big questions.

I also enjoy reading, exploring the mountains, spending time with my family, and traveling.

I am an alumni of [Phillips Exeter Academy](https://www.exeter.edu/), and a student at the [University of Wyoming](http://www.uwyo.edu/).
